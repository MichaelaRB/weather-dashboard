# weather-dashboard
A program that allows the user to pull both today's weather forecast and a 5 day upcoming forecast

## Description
Whether it's traveling for fun or work, it's important to know about the cities you're planning to visit. One of the most important things to know about where you're going is the weather! This program allows the user to search for a city by name, and will display both the current weather and the weather for the next 5 days. 

## Usage
The webpage can be accessed at https://michaelarb.github.io/weather-dashboard/

This is what the deployed website looks like:

On the search bar on the side, the user can type in the name of a city and after clicking the search button, the forecast will appear to the side. The 10 most recent searches will be saved below the search bar, and clicking a previously searched city in the history will pull the results back up.

## Credits
This program makes use of the OpenWeatherMap api for its forecast data.
